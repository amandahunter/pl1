    <header> <h1>Victor Hugo</h1> </header>
    <h2>His head in the clouds, his pen on real paper.</h2>
    <p>A beloved poet, novelist, and damatist, he drew his inspiration from nearby places, and though some of his books were fictitious, the places- 
      and even some of the events- were in fact very real. We will take a peek at some of his most notable literary works and the real locations that inspired these stories.</p>

    <h1>Places of Interest</h1>

      <h2>Musée Victor Hugo</h1>
        <p>Prior to his exile from France in later years for political reasons, Hugo spent most of his life living in Villequier, in a house along the Seine River. 
          His home has been memorialized and made into a museum where some of his journals and drawings are on display. 
          The interior is dark and quiet, a perfect setting for writing, while the view outside along the river is quintessentially French.</p>
      <h2>Notre-Dame Cathedral</h2>
      <p>Disparities between the suffering and the wealthy were stark in 1831, which sparked Hugo's fiction, Notre-Dame de Paris (The hunchback of Notre-Dame). Though the character was fictitious, many scenes 
        from the novel were derived from his observations in Paris which we diligently wrote in his journals. 
        Notre-Dame is a real cathedral located in Paris. </p>
      <h2>Place de la Bastille</h2>
      <p>The Place de la Bastille is a square in Paris where the Bastille prison stood until the storming of the Bastille and its 
subsequent physical destruction between 14 July 1789 and 14 July 1790 during the French Revolution. 
No vestige of the prison remains. The June Rebellion- or the Paris Uprising of 1832 began here, which Hugo was caught up in for several hours. 
He hid in a side street while gunfire was exchanged and barricades were created. This influenced his book Les Miserables which was published some 20 years later. </p>
      <h2>Cimetière de Villequier, Rives-en-Seine</h2>
      <p>Victor Hugo's daughter, Leopoldine (named after his Hugo's father) married Charles Vacquerie where they met a tragic fate. Their boat overturned on the Seine in Villequier on 4 September 1843 and they drowned.
 She was 19 years old and pregnant, her wet, heavy skirts pulled her down, and her husband died trying to save her. This had a heavy impact on Hugo's writing. One of his most famous poems,
 Demain, Des L'Aube tells the story of Hugo visiting his daughter's grave in Villequier.
